# A Basic Scala SBT Project With Scalatest Support

This is a template for a basic Scala/SBT project that already has the needed
dependency reference in build.sbt for Scalatest support. You can check this
project out if you want a template/skeleton directory structure for a new
project that has those things, i.e.:

* It uses a standard SBT directory strucure.
* The dependency line to use Scalatest is already included in build.sbt.
* It includes one source code file and one test file, so out of the box you can
  type 'sbt compile', 'sbt run', and 'sbt test', and (assuming you have SBT
  installed), all those things should work.
